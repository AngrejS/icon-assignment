	<p> Call your local elected officials: Pick up the phone and dial (844) 236-2373. This number will direct you straight to their offices. Introduce where you are from, ask for additional governmental support such as funds, better housing, accessibility to healthcare and resources, a clear path to greencards or citizenships, and more. Urge immediate action to help expand Afghan resettlement programs and distribute resources equitably. Ask your family and friends to join in calling their elected officials. The more phone calls, the better. </p>

This act will help ensure that Afghans do not suffer as a result of the rushed evacuation. If passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, the bill will provide evacuated Afghans with the same basic services and resources other refugees and Special Immigrant Visa recipients have traditionally received and that Congress has mandated for them, according to Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. </p>
